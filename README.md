Hi! I'm a software engineering major at BYU-Idaho! I specialize in AI and Software Design 

Right now I'm interning at Kenect, a car dealership reputation management company. I work on the AiA team, researching and developing Sentiment Analysis options.

On my own time, I'm learning Lua for Pico-8, and messing around in unity!
